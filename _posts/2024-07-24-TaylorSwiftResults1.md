## Spectrogram of the full concert

Spectrogram of the Taylor Swift concert, with some songs annotated. The brighter yellow colors indicate stronger vibrations. The 'ladder structures' shift up and down with the beats per second of the song -- this is probably a result of the fans jumping to the beat, and with that, they generate specific frequencies.

## PETRA's heartbeat

The ‘rainbow blobs’ show the strength of the arriving signals along the fiber but filtered for different frequency bands. So the wider a specific colour band is, the stronger are the waves vibrating in that range. They also help understand from what direction the signal is coming and help us observe along what path the waves are traveling.
This is what we measured during the entire concert with a ring of optical fiber around the PETRA III accelerator ring of DESY, sped up 100x times. 

## Seismic waves in EuXFEL tunnel during Taylor Swift concert in Hamburg

Here, you see that the seismic waves from Love Story and Shake it Off reached all the way through the 3.4km long EuXFEL tunnel!
