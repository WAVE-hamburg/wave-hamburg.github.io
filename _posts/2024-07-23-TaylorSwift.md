## How does the city of Hamburg swing along to Taylor Swift?

With our WAVE glass fiber sensor network, we listen to vibrations underground with a thousand ears. On July 23rd and 24th 2024, Taylor Swift performed at the Volksparkstadion Hamburg, just 2 km from our experiment!

During the two concerts, we offered a livestream of our vibration measurements.
We broadcasted our measurements on the Livestream on 23th of July at 18:00 -- 23:00 CEST
and again on 24th of July at 18:00 -- 23:00 CEST.
Watch this space, we will update with more results over the next few days.

## "Swiftquakes?!" Don't worry, these are not real earthquakes!

These are tiny vibrations! You would not feel them, our measurement device is really sensitive..
You've probably felt the ground shaking a bit when a big truck passes nearby? It's the same effect, just caused by lots of happy people dancing.

We already knew that we should able to pick up vibrations of concerts happening in the Volksparkstadion, since we have already picked concerts e.g. by Metallica in the past. Lots and lots of fans jumping and dancing at the same time will cause the ground to "swing along" a bit.
